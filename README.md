# TRGP

Python implementation of transcriptional regulation model with Gaussian processes based on [GPflow](https://www.gpflow.org/) and [TensorFlow probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability).

TRCD -- main model with constant degradation parameter. 

## Dependencies

See requirenments.txt

## Expeiments:
-- filtering of the genes (identifying differentially expressed genes);
-- optimization of the parameters in transcriptional regulation model;
-- MCMC for uncertainty quantification using MALA.
